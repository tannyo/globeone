            <h1>FAQ&#8217s</h1>
<h2>What is GlobeOne?</h2>
<div class="faq-answer alert alert-info">
  <p>GlobeOne is a financial community that facilitates the full-service “GO Package”. The benefits include a checking account with a debit card and credit line, a security account to help save for the future, and mobile member-to-member domestic and international transfers without the standard fee charge.   It also provides an income opportunity through the personal and global communities, which is funded by the member banks.</p>

<h2>Without branches, how do I get money into GlobeOne?</h2>
<div class="faq-answer alert alert-info">
  <p>There are a number of options. The easiest way is through direct deposit into your account with a member bank, and the member bank may allow you to transfer funds electronically from an account at another financial institution, deposit a check by taking a photo of it with your mobile phone (if your member bank provides these services) or deposit by mail. You could also deposit to your account with a member bank by getting a money order at a local grocery or convenience store, and then depositing it with the mobile app (if your member bank provides this service).</p>

<h2>Does GlobeOne Charge Fees?</h2>
<div class="faq-answer alert alert-info">
  <p>We're not fans of unnecessary fees at GlobeOne. With the exception of the monthly $9.95 membership fee, GlobeOne charges no other fees.</p>
</div>
<h2>If you don’t profit from fees, how do you make money?</h2>
<div class="faq-answer alert alert-info">
  <p>Although we love technology, we do not knock tradition. In the past, banks and financial institutions made most of their profits off interest.
