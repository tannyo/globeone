            <h1>FAQ&#8217s</h1>
<h2>What is GlobeOne?</h2>
<div class="faq-answer alert alert-info">
  <p>GlobeOne is a financial community that provides the full-service &ldquo;GO Package&rdquo;. The benefits include a checking account with a debit card and credit line, a security account to help save for the future, and mobile member-to-member domestic and international transfers at no extra charge. It also provides an income opportunity through the personal and global communities, which is funded by the member banks.</p>
</div>
<h2>How do I get started?</h2>
<div class="faq-answer alert alert-info">
  <p>Enter your email, click &ldquo;Join Us&rdquo;, get approved and get started.</p>
</div>
<h2>Without branches, how do I get money into GlobeOne?</h2>
<div class="faq-answer alert alert-info">
  <p>There are a number of options. The easiest way is through direct deposit into your account with a member bank, but we also allow you to transfer funds electronically from an account at another financial institution, deposit a check by taking a photo of it with your mobile phone (if your member bank provides this service) or deposit by mail. You could also deposit to your account with a member bank by getting a money order at a local grocery or convenience store, and then depositing it with the mobile app (if your member bank provides this service).</p>
</div>
<h2>Does GlobeOne Charge Fees?</h2>
<div class="faq-answer alert alert-info">
  <p>We're not fans of unnecessary fees at GlobeOne. With the exception of the monthly $9.95 membership fee, you can expect to never be hit with unexpected fees. This means there are no overdraft fees, no bounced check fees, no domestic or international transfer fees, and no account maintenance fees. We don't offer tiered service, since we believe all of our customers are equally important. </p>
</div>
<h2>If you don’t profit from fees, how do you make money?</h2>
<div class="faq-answer alert alert-info">
  <p>Although we love technology, we do not knock tradition. In the past, banks and financial institutions made most of their profits off interest. With GlobeOne, member banks return 50% of interest to the Personal and Global Communities. GlobeOne is paid entirely through members’ $9.95 monthly fees.</p>
</div>
<h2>Who can use GlobeOne?</h2>
<div class="faq-answer alert alert-info">
  <p>Our only requirements are that you have a mobile or online device, that the member bank can appropriately verify your identity, and you are at least 18 years of age or as otherwise required by local regulations.</p>
</div>
<h2>What Features do you provide?</h2>
<div class="faq-answer alert alert-info">
  <p>The GlobeOne service provides all your banking needs in one place; a checking account with no minimum balance, a debit card with no fees, a security account that earns interest and saves for the future, and a line of credit. In addition, members can participate in the personal and global community with income opportunities funded by the member banks. You&apos;ll be able to pay bills by mobile phone or online, direct deposit your checks and transfer money from member to member domestically and internationally at no extra charge. The &ldquo;GO Package&rdquo; provides all the necessary financial tools you will need to enhance financial well-being.</p>
</div>
<h2>Does GlobeOne offer bill pay?</h2>
<div class="faq-answer alert alert-info">
  <p>If your member bank provides online bill paying services, you can use your GlobeOne account to utilize them.</p>
</div>
<h2>Is GlobeOne available in other countries outside the United States?</h2>
<div class="faq-answer alert alert-info">
  <p>Yes, we are working to revolutionize financial freedom worldwide.</p>
</div>
<h2>Is there an inactivity fee?</h2>
<div class="faq-answer alert alert-info">
  <p>No we do not charge any added fees other than the monthly fee.</p>
</div>
<h2>Can I get a card if I have bad credit or no credit history?</h2>
<div class="faq-answer alert alert-info">
  <p>Yes, GlobeOne offers our service to everyone, regardless of credit history.  The member bank will not run a credit check on you. Our service was originally designed to help those individuals without traditional banking options, but because of GlobeOne’s mainstream vision, it is beneficial to anyone who joins our community.</p>
