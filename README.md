# GlobeOne Public Website

https://www.globeone.com

My personal repository of the GlobeOne website to make sure that everything is backed up. I had to do this because our SVN had become unstable. I got permission from my boss, Alex Sundukovskiy. He agreed since the site is public and anyone can spider the website to get the source since everything is a text file.
