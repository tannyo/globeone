            <p>&ldquo;I fundamentally believe that global financial inclusion is critical to enable everyone to have simple affordable financial tools, regardless of where they reside, to improve their lives and purchasing power,&rdquo; said Congressman Bonker. &ldquo;GlobeOne’s visionary concept is timely and vital to addressing financial inequality for individuals, families, communities and countries around the world.  I’m proud to be a part of this effort.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Congressman Bonker’s extensive experience in international investment and finance includes representation of some of Russia and China’s largest companies entering the U.S. market. Congressman Bonker formerly served as president of the International Management and Development Institute, a nonprofit organization that sponsored events throughout Europe, bringing together corporate leaders and senior U.S. officials to discuss transatlantic economic, trade and security issues. He was also head of the International Parliamentary Human Rights Foundation and a member of the Rhodes Scholarship Trust for the State of Washington.</p>

            <p>From 1975 to 1989, Congressman Bonker served in the U.S. House of Representatives where he was a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, chairman of the Subcommittee on International Economic Policy and Trade, and headed former House Speaker Tip O’Neill’s Trade Task Force, which led to passage of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act. He is author of America’s Trade Crisis and is a columnist for several major newspapers.</p>

            <p>Mr. Bonker is currently an executive director at APCO Worldwide, a global communications firm, and a member of APCO’s International Advisory Council.</p>

            <p>&ldquo;We are proud to have a leader of Congressman Bonker’s stature on our Advisory Board,&rdquo; said Michael Wolper, GlobeOne member and Chief Marketing Officer.  &ldquo;His perspective on global trade will help the GlobeOne community grow and thrive and his commitment to human rights aligns with our mission: to transform financial inequality through an empowered, supportive global community of members.  We look forward to accomplishing great things together!&rdquo;</p>
