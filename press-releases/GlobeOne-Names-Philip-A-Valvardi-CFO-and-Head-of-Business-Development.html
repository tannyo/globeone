<p><img src="img/phil-a-valvardi.jpg" title="Phil Valvardi CFO and Head of Business Development" alt="Phil Valvardi Image" class="pull-right shadow"><em>Santa Monica, CA – September 3, 2014</em> – GlobeOne, the global financial technology partner for banking the world’s underbanked, announced today that Philip A. Valvardi has joined the firm with the dual role of Chief Financial Officer and Global Head of Business Development.</p>

<p>“Phil brings immense experience and energy as a successful financial services industry executive, payment network    president and entrepreneur,” says GlobeOne.  “He is recognized as an industry leader, with extensive experience building effective relationships with his bank clients, based on his ability to understand their needs and developing solutions that help them succeed.  Moreover, Phil shares our values and passion for working with the unbanked and underbanked to improve their lives and help their communities by providing access to fairly-priced, convenient, financial products and services. We are very pleased to have him join our management team.”</p>

<p>“I am excited to join GlobeOne,” said Valvardi.  “GlobeOne’s innovative service, which creates a global community of unbanked and underbanked members that all share in income and other financial benefits, is unprecedented in taking full advantage of the interconnectivity of the Internet and social media to harness the power of many to help each individual member, their families and communities. GlobeOne has assembled an impressive team to deliver The GlobeOne Package to the world, and I look forward to working with them to reach GlobeOne’s goal of 30 countries and 25 million members by 2020.”</p>

<p>“Banks have been struggling to serve the unbanked and unbanked market. The economics do not work with traditional approaches and channels. GlobeOne’s ground-breaking solution allows banks to serve this segment profitably, while also fulfilling their social responsibility, ” said Valvardi</p>

<p>Valvardi most recently served as the General Manager of the Prepaid Solutions business at Fiserv. He has over 25 years of experience in financial services and payments.  He was CEO of Maverick Network Solutions, a company acquired by Fiserv in March 2011.  He previously served as President of the MAC Network, one of the largest debit networks and processors in the U.S.  He also previously held executive positions in the electronic payments and financial divisions of CoreStates Financial Corp., now part of Wells Fargo Bank.  He holds a BA in Marketing Management from Saint Joseph’s University and an MBA from Drexel University.</p>
