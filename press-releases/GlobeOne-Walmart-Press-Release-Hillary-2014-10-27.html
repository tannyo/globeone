<h1>GlobeOne unveils plans to take low-fee banking even further with market-leading technology and lower fees</h1>

<p><em>Santa Monica, CA – October 27, 2014</em> – Phil Valvardi, Chief Financial Officer of GlobeOne, a financial technology company set to launch in February, applauds Walmart’s rollout of GoBank, a checking account product, but states products like GoBank barely scratch the surface when it comes to tackling global financial inequality.</p>

<p>“Consumers need more powerful financial tools to get ahead and stay there,” says Valvardi. While low-fee banking like GoBank may be a welcome addition to the financial technologies arena, Valvardi attests that more powerful personal economic tools are necessary to offer consumers lasting security. In addition to providing low-fee financial tools, GlobeOne offers its members the means to actually earn extra income every month by building a community of support.</p>

<p>Michael Wolper, GlobeOne Chief Marketing Officer, says GlobeOne’s approach is much more proactive. “By making low-fee banking products available on any mobile device, and by bringing people together in a supportive financial community,” says Wolper, “we’re hoping to finally make a profound, lasting impact on financial exclusion around the world.”</p>

<p>GlobeOne promises to put financial security within reach of everyone, not just the 1%, with easy-to-use interactive tools combined with a membership program that provides even more financial control. For a flat monthly fee of $9.95, GlobeOne members get a Checking account with no minimum balance, a Security account to save with and borrow from, international and domestic money transfers at no extra charge, and more.</p>

<p>In addition, GlobeOne offers consumers a financial tool that’s even more revolutionary—an innovative community approach to banking. When a member signs up for a GlobeOne account, they get access to the unique patent-pending SocialBoost program that allows them to earn income. As their friends and family join the GlobeOne community, the member instantly enjoys the benefits—GlobeOne member banks give approximately 50% of the credit interest they accrue back to the GlobeOne community. Member banks get a new source of profitable customers, reinvest in their economic communities, and expand their consumer base. GlobeOne members can have financial security today, build savings for tomorrow, and receive income every month—for as long as they are members.</p>

<p>“Financial technologies allow us to create so much more than just a better way to bank,” says Wolper, “We can bring people together from all over the world and all walks of life in a community that helps them regain control of their financial futures.”</p>
